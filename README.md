MEDI Buzz: Simplifying Medication Adherence for the Elderly
MEDI Buzz is an innovative solution designed to help elderly patients manage their daily medication schedules effectively and independently. With a buzzer-based notification system, MEDI Buzz ensures that patients never miss a dose of their medications. This project aims to address common challenges faced by elderly individuals, including memory issues, low-tech literacy, and physical limitations.

Key Features:
Buzzer-based Notifications: Timely reminders to take medications.

Mobile & Email Alerts: Backup alerts to ensure no dose is missed.

Middleware Integration: Seamlessly loads prescription data for accuracy.

Future Collaborations with Pharmacies: Enhancing the systemâ€™s robustness and real-time medication tracking.

Technologies Used:
Backend: Java, Spring Boot (API development)

Database: MongoDB (Data storage and management)

Frontend: Mobile app development for buzzer settings (to be developed)

Middleware: Integration for loading prescription data

Hardware: Buzzer system for medication reminders

Future Development:
Hardware Testing: Develop and test the buzzer system.

App Development: Build a mobile application to modify buzzer settings.

Collaborations: Work with pharmacies to ensure smooth integration and data flow.

MEDI Buzz aims to improve medication adherence and help elderly individuals live more independently, offering peace of mind for both patients and caregivers. While the project has not started yet, we are excited to begin development soon and work toward building an impactful solution.
